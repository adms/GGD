/**
 * config.gore@1 — the 濺血 STYLE KNOB (`config/gore.json`, task #39).
 *
 * The roster puts Pikachu, 初音 and 妙蛙種子 next to 死亡騎士 and 鋼彈, so how
 * bloody a landed hit sprays is an art/tone decision and belongs in content:
 *   • `style` — "blood" (red droplets + mist + a fading ground pool; the
 *     shipped default), "stylized" (a damage-type-tinted energy burst, no red
 *     and no ground pool) or "off" (the layer emits nothing at all).
 *   • `intensity` — 0..1, scales droplet counts, sizes and splat opacity.
 *   • `championStyles` — narrows the style for individual champions, so
 *     mechanical / undead / plant champions spray sparks or ichor, not blood.
 *
 * Consumed by the client's `vfx/goreConfig`, where a per-champion entry may
 * only ever REDUCE gore and the player's own setting is a hard floor — which
 * is why "blood" is not an accepted per-champion value. An absent doc leaves
 * the shipped default (blood @ 0.85). Purely presentational: never enters the
 * sim, never affects a damage number.
