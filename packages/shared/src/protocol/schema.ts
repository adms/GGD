/**
 * Colyseus schema — the RELIABLE state channel. Lives in shared so the client
 * can decode patches with identical class definitions. Low-frequency,
 * correctness-critical state (phase/economy/level) rides here; entity
 * transforms also ride here in the skeleton (binary channel is a deferred
 * optimization behind net/snapshot.ts).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — field-declaration pattern: @colyseus/schema v3 installs
 * per-instance tracking accessors in the Schema constructor. Class-field
 * INITIALIZERS compiled with ES2022 [[Define]] semantics (tsx does this
 * regardless of tsconfig's useDefineForClassFields) create own data properties
 * that SHADOW those accessors — the server then crashes on encode the moment a
 * client joins. Therefore every field here is `declare`d (emits nothing) and
 * defaults are assigned in the constructor (assignment = [[Set]] = hits the
 * accessor). Do NOT convert these back to field initializers.
 * Regression: apps/game-server/src/net/encode.test.ts (match-13).
